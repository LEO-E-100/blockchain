# Creating a blockchain in Python

This project was born out of a desire to understand what the block chain
is and how it functions.

The main system will be as well documented (in the code as possible) to
show my thought process. I will also hopefully manage to get my hands on
some relevant books that will explain the core concepts and these will
be explained in the markdown documentation that I will write.

This is primarily a project for my own personal understanding so please
forgive anything unclear!
